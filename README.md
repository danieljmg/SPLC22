## SPLC'22 Models, Categorical Operations and Datasets

This data-set contains:

1. The 5 SPL categories in CQL alongside the 11 tested operations.
2. The 5 SPL Clafer models.
3. The 5 SPL XMLs (for the AAFM Python Framework).
4. The 5 SPL XMLs (for SATIBEA).
5. The previous models are enriched with quality attributes measurements at feature and configuration levels.
6. A Microsoft Excel file with the scalability results obtained.


## Automated Reasoners

- CQL IDE: https://github.com/CategoricalData/CQL
- Clafermoo: http://t3-necsis.cs.uwaterloo.ca:8092/
- AAFM Python Framework: https://pypi.org/project/famapy/
- SATIBEA: https://github.com/jmguo/SMTIBEA


## Requirements

The data-set has been generated using Java JDK 18.0.2 for CQL IDE, Clafermoo, and SATIBEA, and Python 3.9.13 x86_64 for AAFM Python Framework.
